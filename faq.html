              <h1>Q1: What's an eclipse, anyway?</h1>
              <p>An eclipse is like a space surprise! It happens when the Sun, Moon, and Earth play a special game of hide-and-seek in the sky. Sometimes, the Moon hides the Sun, making it all dark for a bit, and that's a solar eclipse. Other times, the Earth hides the Moon, and it can turn all red, and that's a lunar eclipse.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="hidden">
              <h1>Q2: Why don't eclipses happen all the time?</h1>
              <p>Eclipses are like rare cosmic treats. Imagine your favorite ice cream â€“ you can't have it every day, right? Eclipses are like that. They only happen when the Sun, Earth, and Moon line up perfectly or almost perfectly.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="hidden">
              <h1>Q3: Can we see a lunar eclipse during the day?</h1>
              <p>Nope! Lunar eclipses are nighttime shows. It's when the Earth covers the Moon with its shadow. Sometimes, the Moon can look all red and magical during a lunar eclipse because of Earth's shadow.              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="hidden">
              <h1>Q4: Is it safe to look at a solar eclipse?</h1>
              <p>Solar eclipses are like the Sun's sneak attack. Looking at a solar eclipse with your regular eyes is like staring at a super bright flashlight â€“ it can hurt your eyes! So, always use special eclipse glasses or other safe ways to watch, like a pinhole projector.              </p>

            <section class="hidden">
              <h1>Q5: What's an annular eclipse?</h1>
              <p>An annular eclipse is like a cosmic donut! It happens when the Moon is a bit far away from Earth and can't cover the Sun entirely. So, we see a shiny ring of the Sun around the Moon, just like a donut with a hole in the middle.              </p>

            <section class="hidden">
              <h1>Q6: Do animals act strange during an eclipse?</h1>
              <p> Yep, animals can be like eclipse detectives! Birds might think it's bedtime during a solar eclipse, and nighttime animals might wake up. They get a bit confused, just like when we change our daily routines.

              <h1>Q7: Can I see an eclipse from anywhere on Earth?</h1>
              <p>Eclipses are like special guests, and they visit different places on Earth each time. So, you might need to travel to see one. But don't worry, sometimes they visit your neighborhood!

              <h1>Q8: Do other planets have eclipses?</h1>
              <p>Yep, other planets in space have their own eclipse shows. It's like a space party with planets and their moons. Jupiter and Saturn have big ones, and Mars even has mini moon eclipses!

              <p>Eclipses are like magical moments in the sky, and they can teach us lots of fun things about space. So, keep looking up, and you might catch one someday!
