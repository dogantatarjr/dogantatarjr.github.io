              <h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Total Lunar Eclipse</h1>
              <p> Imagine it's like a fantastic space show: a total lunar eclipse is when the Moon, Earth, and Sun line up perfectly. 🌝🌍🌞
                So, when the Moon is on one side of Earth, the Sun is on the other side, and Earth is in the middle, something cool happens. <br><br> Earth's shadow covers up the Moon, like a giant space umbrella!
                But here's where it gets really awesome: even though the Moon is in the shadow, some sunlight manages to sneak through. But here's the trick – the sunlight has to travel through Earth's special air before it reaches the Moon.
                <br><br>
                Now, Earth's air is like a magical filter. It loves to play with sunlight! It lets some colors through, like red and orange, but it likes to hide the blue ones. So, when the sunlight goes through Earth's air, it loses its blue colors and turns all red and orangey.
                <br><br>This magical transformation gives the Moon a cool new look during a total lunar eclipse. It's like the Moon puts on a fabulous red dress, and we call it the "blood moon." 🩰🌒🌓🌔
                So, when you look up at the sky during a total lunar eclipse, you'll see the Moon looking all dressed up in its red outfit, and it's a spectacular show for everyone on Earth to enjoy!

              <h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Partial Lunar Eclipses</h1>
              <p>Think of a partial lunar eclipse as a cool space adventure for the Moon. 🌔🌍🌓
                Imagine the Moon is having a big space picnic with the Sun and Earth. They're hanging out, but then Earth decides to play a fun game of hide-and-seek with the Moon.    
                Earth's shadow is like a giant space blanket, and it starts covering up a part of the Moon, just like when you cover half of your sandwich with a napkin. 🥪🌒
                <br><br>
                So, when Earth's shadow starts covering the Moon, that part of the Moon looks a bit darker compared to the rest. It's like the Moon is wearing a special half-dark, half-bright outfit! Now, here's where it gets exciting: the way the Moon looks during this cosmic game depends on how the Sun, Earth, and Moon are lined up. Sometimes, Earth's shadow covers just a little part of the Moon, and other times, it covers more.  
                <br><br>
                So, when you look up at the sky during a partial lunar eclipse, you'll see the Moon wearing its special outfit, but the style and how much it's covered can change, like playing dress-up with the Moon! 🌌👗🌕
